# Oil Spill Segmentation and Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to tackle the environmental issue of oil spills by using advanced machine learning techniques for segmentation and classification. The project utilizes a U-Net architecture for segmenting oil spills in images and applies clustering techniques like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for classification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Models Used
- **U-Net**: Convolutional Network for high-performance image segmentation.
- **RCNN**: Region-based Convolutional Neural Network for detailed segmentation tasks.
- **VGG16**: Used as a base for transfer learning approaches in feature extraction.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**
- **Dice Coefficient**
- For clustering:
  - **Silhouette Score**
  - **Davies-Bouldin Index**

## Results
The U-Net model demonstrated robust performance with an excellent IoU and Dice Coefficient. K-Means clustering achieved a silhouette score of 0.9, whereas GMM achieved 0.7.

## Next Steps
Future work includes improving the model's accuracy with more complex architectures like ResNet and expanding the web application for real-time monitoring.
