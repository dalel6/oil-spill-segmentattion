# Oil Spill Segmentation and Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to tackle the environmental issue of oil spills by using advanced machine learning techniques for segmentation and classification. The project utilizes a U-Net architecture for segmenting oil spills in images and applies clustering techniques like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for classification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the training and test datasets.
- `models/`: Contains saved model files and architecture configurations.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for training, testing, and evaluation.
- `webapp/`: Source files for the interactive web application.

## Usage
To train the model, run:
```
python scripts/train_model.py
```
To segment and classify images:
```
python scripts/segment_classify.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```
For launching the web application:
```
python webapp/app.py
```

## Models Used
- **U-Net**: Convolutional Network for high-performance image segmentation.
- **RCNN**: Region-based Convolutional Neural Network for detailed segmentation tasks.
- **VGG16**: Used as a base for transfer learning approaches in feature extraction.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**
- **Dice Coefficient**
- For clustering:
  - **Silhouette Score**
  - **Davies-Bouldin Index**

## Results
The U-Net model demonstrated robust performance with an excellent IoU and Dice Coefficient. K-Means clustering achieved a silhouette score of 0.9, whereas GMM achieved 0.7.

## Next Steps
Future work includes improving the model's accuracy with more complex architectures like ResNet and expanding the web application for real-time monitoring.
